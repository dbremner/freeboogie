This version is for developers & researchers on program verifiers.
It is not yet ready for prime-time. FreeBoogie is developed in Java
so it should work on many platforms. The tests and some other
development helpers, however, are Linux (or UNIX?) specific.
The rest assumes that you are on Linux.

Try this:
  source setenv
  ant test
  fbrun freeboogie.Main -help
  fbrun freeboogie.Main -pfg boogie_Bag2.bpl

Enjoy.

Note: Now working on VC generation.
