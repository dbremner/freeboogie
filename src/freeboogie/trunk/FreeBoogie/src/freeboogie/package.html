<h1>Style</h1>

<ul>
<li>lightweight JML specs for each method.
<li>the javadocs must look ok
<li>escjava must be run periodically
<li>unit tests for each class
<li>each class has a main method that allows interactive testing of its
   functionality
<li>functional tests
<li>the bytecode for all tests (unit/func) must be obtained with the JML
   compiler, once it supports Java 5
<li>I use Java 5
 
<li>each file and design document must have a reviewer: use all the people
   in the group for this (Joe, Mikolas, Fintan, Robin) from the beginning
   so they are familiar with the content
<li>all files are authored by me: I accept patches only after I review them
   and convert them to my style (I know, I know, ...)
</ul>
