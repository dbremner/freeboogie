STYLE

 * lightweight JML specs for each method.
 * the javadocs must look ok
 * escjava must be run periodically
 * unit tests for each class
 * each class has a main method that allows interactive testing of its
   functionality
 * functional tests
 * the bytecode for all tests (unit/func) must be obtained with the JML
   compiler, once it supports Java 5
 * I use Java 5
 
 * each file and design document must have a reviewer: use all the people
   in the group for this (Joe, Mikolas, Fintan, Robin) from the beginning
   so they are familiar with the content
 * all files are authored by me: I accept patches only after I review them
   and convert them to my style (I know, I know, ...)
