<p>This package was originally developed by <a href="http://nemerle.org/~malekith/">
Michal Moskal</a> as a backend for ESC/Java2. I (rgrig) have
ripped the source and mercilesly butchered it. The original license
was also MIT.</p>

<p>The idea is that this package is supposed to be self-contained and
used by the rest of FreeBoogie as a black box that wraps different provers.
FreeBoogie only calls methods from the NodeBuilder interface to build
a query and then Methods from the SortedProver interface to get the
reply of the theorem prover.</p>
