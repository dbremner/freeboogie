 . Finish passivate; now you can use fancy generics to deal with arrays
 . Implement a generic UNION-FIND DS and use it in Inferrer and TypeChecker.
 . Test typechecker thoroughly and add tests for the 'old' mode.
 . Perhaps introduce dummy names where the user doesn't provide one
   instead of carrying nulls around, which are hard to track.
 . Write an ant target that runs FindBugs.
 . Does ImplementationChecker treat type vars correctly?
 . The comments and code disagree for TypeChecker.checkExact
 . Desugar dependent types in assumes/asserts
 . Desugar function calls into assumes/asserts (remember that free is special)
 . Desugar specs into assumes/asserts (introduces two? new blocks)
 . Transform BoogiePL expressions into SmtTerms (SmtTermBuilder)
   Take care of arrays (does the prover know about arrays?)
 . Extract sharing in SimplifyProver, or use `flet' for z3
 . When making SmtTerms do small simplifications for "and", "or"
   (such as skip "TRUE", respectively "FALSE"; and return
   neutral element when there are no operands)
 . Cut out loops
 . Make flowgraph reducible
 . Simple interface to parse from strings
 . In some cases Spec# generates (assume ... h1[n1] == h2[n2]...) which
   gets 'fixed' in old mode by adding a generic on procedure/implementation.
   Is this a problem?
 . What is the most elegant way to write frame axioms in FB with generics?
 . Add a "for all types" construct.
 . Hash-consing Type (and subclasses) might simplify code.
 . Test if errors are reported correctly in old mode.
 . Check performance.
 . A log Formatter that uses a line per record.
 . Get someone to review the code.
 . Implement the 'transform' (desugar) function in the parser.
   This makes sure there is exactly one command in each block
   and simplifies later steps.
 . Move to Boogie 2 (and still support the old form only if needed by
   benchmarks or bml2bpl)
 . Change the grammar so it doesn't use syntactic predicates. NOTE:
   You may need to return tuples.
