 . Fix type-checking in "old" mode by a bit of type inference.
 . Test typechecker thoroughly.
 . Perhaps introduce dummy names where the user doesn't provide one
   instead of carrying nulls around, which are hard to track.
 . Write an ant target that runs FindBugs.
 . Does ImplementationChecker treat type vars correctly?
 . The comments and code disagree for TypeChecker.checkExact
 . Check that everything in the test "functional/parser" typechecks
   in "old" mode
 . Finish passivate; now you can use fancy generics to deal with arrays
 . Desugar dependent types in assumes/asserts
 . Desugar function calls into assumes/asserts (remember that free is special)
 . Desugar specs into assumes/asserts (introduces two? new blocks)
 . Transform BoogiePL expressions into SmtTerms (SmtTermBuilder)
   Take care of arrays (does the prover know about arrays?)
 . Extract sharing in SimplifyProver, or use `flet' for z3
 . When making SmtTerms do small simplifications for "and", "or"
   (such as skip "TRUE", respectively "FALSE"; and return
   neutral element when there are no operands)
 . Cut out loops
 . Make flowgraph reducible
 . Simple interface to parse from strings
 . In some cases Spec# generates (assume ... h1[n1] == h2[n2]...) which
   gets 'fixed' in old mode by adding a generic on procedure/implementation.
   Is this a problem?
 . What is the most elegant way to write frame axioms in FB with generics?
 . Add a "for all types" construct.
 . Hash-consing Type (and subclasses) might simplify code.
 . Test if errors are reported correctly in old mode.
