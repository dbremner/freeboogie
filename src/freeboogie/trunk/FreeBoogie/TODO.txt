 . Desugar dependent types in procedure signatures.
 . Transform Boogie expressions into SmtTerms (SmtTermBuilder)
   Take care of arrays (does the prover know about arrays?)
 . Extract sharing in SimplifyProver, or use `flet' for z3
 . Provide a web interface.
 . Release FreeBoogie 0.1. Package it with jml2bml, bml2bpl, z3, and
   one Java example. Test end-to-end.
 . Change the grammar and the AST to allow for parallel assignments.
 . Implement a generic UNION-FIND DS and use it in Inferrer and TypeChecker.
 . Test typechecker thoroughly and add tests for the 'old' mode.
 . Does ImplementationChecker treat type vars correctly?
 . The comments and code disagree for TypeChecker.checkExact
 . When making SmtTerms do small simplifications for "and", "or"
   (such as skip "TRUE", respectively "FALSE"; and return
   neutral element when there are no operands)
 . Make flow graphs reducible
 . Simple interface to parse from strings
 . In some cases Spec# generates (assume ... h1[n1] == h2[n2]...) which
   gets 'fixed' in old mode by adding a generic on procedure/implementation.
   Is this a problem?
 . Add a "for all types" construct.
 . Test if errors are reported correctly in old mode.
 . Get someone to review the code.
 . Implement the 'transform' (desugar) function in the parser.
   This makes sure there is exactly one command in each block
   and simplifies later steps.
 . Move to Boogie 2 (and still support the old form only if needed by
   benchmarks or bml2bpl)
 . Change the grammar so it doesn't use syntactic predicates. NOTE:
   You may need to return tuples.
 . Check (during type-check) that I never assign to a constant.
 . Incorporate IndexedType into UserType, and allow for an arbitrary
   number of type arguments (besides the name).
 . There is some duplication between VarCollector and ReadWriteSetFinder.
   Probably only one should remain.
 . Update my ViM configuration so it stops inserting // in Java mode
   (see :h 'comments')
 . Don't allow assignments to input parameters.
 . Make the latest Boogie.exe from MSR work on Linux.
 . Performance: get rid of the exception in
     freeboogie.tc.Specializer.prepareTypeList.
 . Performance: Clear your hashes instead of initializing new ones.
 . Performance: Set the initial size of hashes appropriately.
 . Most transformations during VC generation treat ignore generics
   completely. This should be fine in Boogie 2, but not when
   explicit specialization is allowed.
 . Migrate to Google Code. First, patch svndumpfilter so that it
   works correctly, at least for extracting FreeBoogie from
   mobius.ucd.ie.
 . Desugar where clauses too in SpecDesugarer.
 . Implement an IdCleaner that maps all ids to a, b, ..., z, aa, ab, ...
 . Implement an (almost) topological sorter for blocks to make things
   easier to read.
 . Implement type synonyms.
 . There is lots of code shared by various desugarers. Find a way
   to write it only once.
 . Move Desugareres in VcGenerator, out of the main loop.
 . Make sure collection objects are reused when processing multiple
   files. That means, for example, that you instantiate VcGenerator
   only once per run (not once per file) from freeboogie.Main.
 . Performance: It should work with a stack of 64MB and a heap of
   64MB. Right now it eats too much memory.
 . Make TermOfExpr sorted.
 . Target the native format of Z3.
 . Target the SMTLIB format.
