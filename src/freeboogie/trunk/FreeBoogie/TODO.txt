34 VC generation design
24 VC generation implementation
 6 simple interface to parse from strings

 . should arrays be allowed as indices in arrays?
 . update type checker for sane type variables
 . does ImplementationChecker treat type vars correctly?
 . add implicit type variables (h:[ref,<x>name]x -> h<x>:[ref...)
 . desugar dependent types in assumes/asserts
 . Transform BoogiePL expressions into SmtTerms (SmtTermBuilder)
   Take care of arrays
 . extract sharing in SimplifyProver, or use `flet' for z3
 . when making SmtTerms do small simplifications for "and", "or"
   (such as skip "TRUE", respectivelly "FALSE"; and return
   neutral element when there are no operands)
