 . Convert the BPLs in the test suite to Boogie 2.
 . Add a "for all types" construct. (?)
 . Move to Boogie 2.
 . Release 0.2.
 . Add a switch on the command line to use the Coq generation (generate the nodes to a file)
 . Add axioms for %. (It it NOT built in in "z3 -si".)
 . Configure the new categories/levels for logging/output.
   (Search for "log-categ" to see places that must be fixed.)
 . Process triggers.
 . Release 0.3.
 . Reorganize the code for turning on/off various phases.
 . Add null-by-default switch to bml2bpl.
 . Move astgen tests to astgen.
 . Release 0.4.
 . Simple interface to parse from strings.
 . Re-think what goes in TermBuilder and what goes in SmtTermBuilder.
 . Desugar dependent types in procedure signatures.
 . Release 0.5.
 . Provide a web interface.
 . Have some unified mechanism for making sure that terms start with
   "term$$". Check that term$$ is not prepended to number literals.
 . Have a way to cope with identifiers in the input that contain $$.
   In general, think harder about possible name clashes.
 . Release 0.6.
 . Only parse functions if they return exactly one value.
 . Change the grammar and the AST to allow for parallel assignments.
 . Implement a generic UNION-FIND DS and use it in Inferrer and TypeChecker.
 . Release 0.7.
 . Test typechecker thoroughly.
 . Does ImplementationChecker treat type vars correctly?
 . The comments and code disagree for TypeChecker.checkExact
 . Release 0.8
 . Make flow graphs reducible
 . Get someone to review the code.
 . Release 0.9.
 . Change the grammar so it doesn't use syntactic predicates. NOTE:
   You may need to return tuples.
 . Check (during type-check) that I never assign to a constant.
 . There is some duplication between VarCollector and ReadWriteSetFinder.
   Probably only one should remain.
 . Release 0.10.
 . Don't allow assignments to input parameters.
 . Make the latest Boogie.exe from MSR work on Linux.
 . Performance: get rid of the exception in
     freeboogie.tc.Specializer.prepareTypeList.
 . Release 0.11
 . Performance: Clear your hashes instead of initializing new ones.
 . Performance: Set the initial size of hashes appropriately.
 . Migrate to Google Code. First, patch svndumpfilter so that it
   works correctly, at least for extracting FreeBoogie from
   mobius.ucd.ie.
 . Release 0.12.
 . Desugar where clauses too in SpecDesugarer.
 . Introduce an option to topologically sort blocks.
 . There is lots of code shared by various desugarers. Find a way
   to write it only once.
 . Release 0.13.
 . Make sure collection objects are reused when processing multiple
   files. That means, for example, that you instantiate VcGenerator
   only once per run (not once per file) from freeboogie.Main.
 . Performance: It should work with a stack of 64MB and a heap of
   64MB. Right now it eats too much memory.
 . Make TermOfExpr (more) sorted. And test it more extensively.
 . Release 0.14.
 . Use the Z3 API, if possible on Linux.
 . Target the SMTLIB format.
 . Report the location of the implementation being checked.
 . Release 0.15.
 . Add a parser for SMT so that you can provide a piece of text to
   build an SmtTerm.
 . Releas 0.16.
