   <description url="http://kind.ucd.ie/products/opensource/FreeBoogie/">
      This version is for developers &amp; researchers on program verifiers.
It is not yet ready for prime-time. FreeBoogie is developed in
Java 1.6
so it should work on many platforms. The tests and some other
development helpers, however, are Linux (or UNIX?) specific.
The rest assumes that you are on Linux.
Try this:
source setenv
ant test
fbrun freeboogie.Main --help
fbrun freeboogie.Main -pfg boogie_Bag2.bpl
Enjoy.
Note: Now working on VC generation.
