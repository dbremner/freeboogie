This version is for developers & researchers on program
verifiers. It is not yet ready for prime-time. FreeBoogie is
developed in Java so it should work on many platforms. The tests
and some other development helpers, however, are Linux specific.

The rest assumes that you are on Linux.

Try this:
  source setenv
  ant test
  fbrun freeboogie.Main -help
  fbrun freeboogie.Main -pfg test/functional/parser/boogie_Bag2.bpl

Enjoy.
